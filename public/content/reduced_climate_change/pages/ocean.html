    Scientists have found that with every 1Â°C rise in global temperature, the ocean levels will rise by about 1 meter. According to their research, the Netherlands, Bangladesh, and the coral island Majuro in Oceania will be among the first areas of the world to suffer if the ocean levels continue to rise.
