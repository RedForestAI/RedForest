    Another problem related to global warming has started to happen. Many dry areas, including the American West, Southern Africa, and Australia have been experiencing more severe <a id="droughts_water_cycle-anchor-1" href="drought">droughts</a> in recent years. In fact, the amount of land on the Earth suffering from <a id="droughts_water_cycle-anchor-2" href="drought">drought</a> has doubled since 1970. The reason for this is complicated. As the <a id="droughts_water_cycle-anchor-3" href="globaltemp">Earth's temperature</a> increases, the air's ability to hold water vapor increases. We call this carrying capacity. So when <a id="droughts_water_cycle-anchor-4" href="globaltemp">global temperatures</a> increase, the carrying capacity of the atmosphere also increases. When carrying capacity grows, it takes longer for the air to fill up. Because of this, there is less <a id="droughts_water_cycle-anchor-5" href="condensation">condensation</a>.

    Condensation is how water vapor in the air is changed into a liquid form. When the air is completely full of <a id="droughts_water_cycle-anchor-6" href="water_vapor">water vapor</a>, we say that it is saturated. Condensation happens when saturated air cools. When saturated air cools, its carrying capacity lowers and it can no longer hold all of its <a id="droughts_water_cycle-anchor-7" href="water_vapor">water vapor</a>. When this happens, condensation takes place and the extra water vapor turns back into liquid water droplets, or precipitation. These water droplets then fall to Earth. Condensation can't happen without a lot of water vapor in the air. If there isn't any water vapor in the air when it cools, no condensation will happen. So the more water vapor there is, the more condensation there is.

    Condensation increases the amount of precipitation that falls to the earth. Precipitation is the water that falls to the Earth. When this water is in liquid form we call it rain. When it is solid we call it snow. This precipitation then evaporates in the hot sun, creating more water vapor. This new water vapor will eventually condense, become precipitation, and then fall to the planet's surface again. This is called the water cycle, and it keeps happening over and over again. Over time, water vapor keeps condensing, falling to the earth, and again becoming water vapor.

    So what does the water cycle have to do with droughts? A drought is a long period of lower than normal rainfall in a region. When there is a drought, <a id="droughts_water_cycle-anchor-8" href="vegetation">vegetation</a> does not get the water it needs to survive and begins to die off. <a id="droughts_water_cycle-anchor-9" href="precipitation">Precipitation</a> reduces drought. The problem is this: as the global temperature rises, so does carrying capacity. This limits the amount of condensation, which limits the amount of precipitation. The lower amounts of precipitation increase the amount of drought in an area.

    Occasional droughts are normal for the Earth's climate. However, droughts may become more common because of increased greenhouse effects. The table below shows how droughts have become more severe in recent years.
