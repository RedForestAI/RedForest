<h1 id="def_and_co2-heading">Deforestation and Carbon Dioxide</h1>
<p id="def_and_co2-p1">
    Deforestation is the removal of vegetation from an area. The more deforestation there is, the less <a id="def_and_co2-anchor-1" href="vegetation">vegetation</a> there is. Vegetation includes all trees, plants, shrubs and grass that grow on the Earth. Vegetation is important for the global climate for two reasons. First, vegetation releases water vapor into the air. This additional water vapor indirectly helps reduce the amount of drought in an area. Second, vegetation absorbs <a id="def_and_co2-anchor-2" href="carbon_dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> from the air during photosynthesis. So, the more vegetation there is, the less <a id="def_and_co2-anchor-3" href="carbon_dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> there will be in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. It traps heat in the earth's atmosphere, and that increases the amount of heat reflected to the earth. This heat reflected to the earth indirectly increases the earth's average global temperature. So, deforestation indirectly raises the average global temperature.
