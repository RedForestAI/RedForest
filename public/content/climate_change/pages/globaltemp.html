    Temperatures in our local region change based on day and season. Temperatures in places around the world might be very different from each other. It's often freezing in Antarctica and hot in the Sahara desert at the same time.

    So why do people say that the Earth is getting warmer?

<p id="globaltemp-p3">
    When we talk about global warming and climate change, we are not talking about the temperature of just one place. Instead, we are talking about the average global temperature of the whole world. Some places may be hotter or colder, but the global temperature tells us how hot or cold the whole Earth is on average.
