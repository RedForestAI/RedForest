<p id="heat-p1">
    The Earth absorbs about half of the <a id="heat-anchor-1" href="solar_energy">solar energy</a> it receives. Once absorbed, this <a id="heat-anchor-2" href="absorbed_light_energy">abosorbed light energy</a> is converted to <a id="heat-anchor-3" href="absorbed_heat_energy">absorbed heat energy</a>. The <a id="heat-anchor-4" href="absorbed_heat_energy">absorbed heat energy</a> makes the Earth warmer.

<p id="heat-p2">
    The rest of the <a id="heat-anchor-5" href="absorbed_heat_energy">absorbed heat energy</a> drifts away from the earth's surface and moves back towards outer space. Some of this heat is blocked by the earth's atmosphere. Gases in the atmosphere called "greenhouse gases" block escaping heat and reflect it back toward Earth. We call this "heat reflected to the earth."
