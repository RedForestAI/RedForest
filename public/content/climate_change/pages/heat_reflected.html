<p id="heat_reflected-p1">
    The Earth absorbs about half of the <a id="heat_reflected-anchor-1" href="solar_energy">solar energy</a> it receives. Once absorbed, this <a id="heat_reflected-anchor-2" href="absorbed_light_energy">absorbed light energy</a> is converted to <a id="heat_reflected-anchor-3" href="absorbed_heat_energy">absorbed heat energy</a>. The <a id="heat_reflected-anchor-4" href="absorbed_heat_energy">absorbed heat energy</a> makes the Earth warmer.

    The rest of the <a id="heat_reflected-anchor-5" href="absorbed_heat_energy">absorbed heat energy</a> drifts away from the earth's surface and moves back towards outer space. This is where the greenhouse effect comes in. Some of the heat that drifts toward outer space is actually blocked by the earth's atmosphere. Gases in the atmosphere called "greenhouse gases" block escaping heat and reflect it back toward Earth. Two important greenhouse gases are methane and carbon dioxide. When this heat is reflected back to the earth, it is re-absorbed by the earth's surface and becomes absorbed heat energy.

    Normally, there is a balance between the amount of solar energy absorbed by the earth and the amount of heat energy that radiates away from the Earth. <a id="heat_reflected-anchor-6" href="absorbed_light_energy">Absorbed light energy</a> indirectly increases <a id="heat_reflected-anchor-7" href="globaltemp">global temperature</a>, but heat radiation indirectly lowers it. Some scientists believe that human activity is disturbing this balance. They believe that humans are increasing the amount of heat reflected to the earth by adding a large amount of extra carbon dioxide and methane to the atmosphere.
