    Everything in the universe is made of atoms and molecules, and heat energy actually describes how fast these particles are moving. The energy of motion is called kinetic energy, so why do we call it heat energy? Well, objects with more kinetic energy feel hot to us. When they touch us, some of the kinetic energy is transferred to us, and that makes us feel hotter.  Heat energy comes from the motion of these particles. The more they move, the more energy they have.
