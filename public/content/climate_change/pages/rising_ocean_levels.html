    <a id="rising_ocean_levels-anchor-1" href="earth_trouble">Human activities</a> in the last century have been adding large amounts of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. This is making the greenhouse effect stronger. If greenhouse gases and the global warming that they indirectly cause are not reduced, they have the potential to cause catastrophic problems for the Earth and its inhabitants. Some of these problems include rising <a id="rising_ocean_levels-anchor-3" href="ocean">ocean levels</a>, <a id="rising_ocean_levels-anchor-4" href="coastal_flooding">coastal flooding</a>, and <a  id="rising_ocean_levels-anchor-5" href="drought">drought</a>.

    One of these problems, rising <a id="rising_ocean_levels-anchor-6" href="ocean">ocean levels</a>, might already be happening. In fact, the world's oceans have already risen 4-8 inches. As the <a id="rising_ocean_levels-anchor-7" href="globaltemp">global temperature</a> has increased, sea ice in the Arctic and Antarctic has started to melt. It's like putting an ice cube in a cup of hot water. As the sea ice melts, it turns into water. When ice turns into water, it takes up more space than it does when it is frozen. Because of this, sea ice actually limits the ocean levels, and the more sea ice we have, the lower the ocean levels will be. But when sea ice melts, ocean levels rise. As a result, people living in some South Pacific islands and off of the coast of India have had to move to higher ground. These people are moving away because as the ocean levels rise, the water from the oceans creeps farther and farther onto the land. We call this coastal flooding, and higher ocean levels cause more coastal flooding. Areas that are low to the ground include some of the world's largest cities. If these areas flood, millions of people around the world might have to find new places to live.
