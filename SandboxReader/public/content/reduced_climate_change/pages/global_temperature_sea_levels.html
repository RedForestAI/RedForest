    Temperatures in our local area vary based on day and season. Temperatures around the world might be very different from each other. It can be freezing in Antarctica and blistering in the Sahara Desert at the same time. Some places may be hotter or colder, but the global temperature tells us how hot or cold Earth is on average.

    As the global temperature has risen, sea ice in the Arctic and Antarctic have started to melt. Sea ice can take several forms with some giant icebergs floating in the ocean and others large ice masses attached to the land. When sea ice melts, it's like placing an ice cube in a cup of hot water! As the sea ice melts, it turns into water. This takes up more volume than ice.

    There is evidence rising ocean levels might already be happening. In fact, the world's oceans have risen 4-8 inches. More coastal flooding is happening, which occurs when ocean levels rise and the water from the ocean creeps onto the land. Areas that are low to the ground include some of the world's largest cities. If these areas flood, millions of people around the world might have to find new places to live.
