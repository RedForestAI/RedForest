<p id="deforestation-p1">
    Deforestation is when people reduce the amount of vegetation in an area. It happens when people cut down trees or other plants. Vegetation includes all trees, plants, shrubs, and grass that grow on the Earth. Vegetation is important for the global climate for two reasons. First, plants give off water vapor into the air. This lessens droughts in an area. Second, plants absorb carbon dioxide from the air during photosynthesis. So, there is less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere because there are trees and plants growing on Earth.

    Why is that important? We are seeing more droughts because the higher temperatures are drying things like dirt. Also, carbon dioxide is a colorless greenhouse gas found in the atmosphere. That means that we can't see it. It is in the air and sky. The chemical formula for carbon dioxide is CO2. Scientists believe that carbon dioxide, mainly created by human activity, is making the greenhouse effect worse. Humans are cutting down forests. This creates more farmlands and expands cities. But it means there is less vegetation on our planet. Deforestation is one of the main ways that humans could be causing global warming.
