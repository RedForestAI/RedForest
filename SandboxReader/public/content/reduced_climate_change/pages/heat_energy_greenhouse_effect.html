<p id="garbage-p1">
    Heat energy is an important part of the greenhouse effect. Everything in the universe is made of atoms and molecules. Heat energy describes how fast these particles are moving. The more they move, the more energy and heat they have. Heat energy contributes to global warming.

    Solar energy adds heat energy to Earth. The Earth absorbs about half of the solar energy it receives. This becomes absorbed heat energy and makes the Earth warmer. What is not absorbed drifts away from the earth's surface and moves back towards outer space.

    This is where the greenhouse effect comes in. Some of the heat that drifts toward outer space is actually blocked by the earth's atmosphere. Gases in the atmosphere called "greenhouse gases" block escaping heat and reflect it back toward Earth. Two important greenhouse gases are methane and carbon dioxide. When this heat is reflected back to the earth, it is re-absorbed by the earth's surface and becomes more absorbed heat energy, and more heat. As people add more greenhouse gases to the earth, more heat is reflected back to the earth.
