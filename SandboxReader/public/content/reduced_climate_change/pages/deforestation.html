<p id="deforestation-p1">
    Deforestation is a process by which humans reduce the amount of <a id="deforestation-anchor-1" href="vegetation">vegetation</a> in an area. Humans are rapidly cutting down forests in order to create more farmland and expand cities. Because of this, there is less <a id="deforestation-anchor-2" href="vegetation">vegetation</a> on our planet. Deforestation is one of the primary ways that human activity could be causing global warming.
