<p id="seaice-p1">
    Sea ice can take several forms. Some of it is seen as giant icebergs floating in the ocean. Near the polar regions of the Earth, there are large ice masses attached to the land. The polar ice caps are the size of whole continents! Sea ice is the main habitat for polar bears, ringed seals, and ice algae.
