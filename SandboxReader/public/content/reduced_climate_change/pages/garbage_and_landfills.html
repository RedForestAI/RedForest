<p id="garbage-p1">
    Garbage is another human activity that could be causing global warming. The typical American throws away about five pounds of trash a day. That makes 251 million tons of garbage a year! Garbage isn't just things that we throw away in our homes. Garbage is also what we throw away in our jobs. For example, when we build or fix buildings, we throw away a lot of construction materials. Also, when we mine rocks from the ground, we use up and eventually throw away tools and equipment that help us get the job done. Garbage is icky.

    Some trash gets recycled or burned, but most trash is buried in landfills. In fact, only 35% of trash gets recycled. Plastic is even worse with only 8% of plastics recycled. A landfill is a place where a lot of garbage is buried underground. In landfills, garbage decays and releases methane into the environment. Methane is a colorless, odorless gas. Like carbon dioxide, more methane makes the greenhouse effect worse. It increases the heat reflected to the earth. Garbage creation is one of the human activities that contributes to global warming.
