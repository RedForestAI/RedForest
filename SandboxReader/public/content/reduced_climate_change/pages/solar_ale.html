    You might have heard about the greenhouse effect on television or in your science classes. That is because the greenhouse effect is important to how the world normally works. By trapping heat generated by the sun, the greenhouse effect keeps the earth warm enough to support life.

    The whole process starts with solar energy, which is generated by the sun about 150 million kilometers from the Earth. Most of the sun is made of hydrogen gas. Through a process called <b>nuclear fusion</b>, some of the hydrogen in the sun is turned into helium. This releases a huge amount of energy!  The energy from nuclear fusion in the sun is radiated into space as electromagnetic waves. <b>Solar energy</b> is electromagnetic radiation that carries the energy of the sun to the Earth.

    When <a id="solar_ale-anchor-1" href="solar_energy">solar energy</a> reaches the Earth's surface, the Earth absorbs it. Once it has been absorbed, we call it absorbed light energy. The more solar energy that the Earth receives, the more light energy it will absorb.  The Earth does not absorb all of the solar energy it receives. Some <a id="solar_ale-anchor-2" href="solar_energy">solar energy</a> is reflected back into space by the atmosphere before ever reaching the Earth's surface. Other <a id="solar_ale-anchor-3" href="solar_energy">solar energy</a> is reflected back into space by sea ice, which is a good reflector of light. When there is more <a id="solar_ale-anchor-4" href="seaice">sea ice</a> covering the earth's surface, there will be less absorbed light energy.
